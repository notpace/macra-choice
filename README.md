# macra-choice
This a prototype of a website that introduces healthcare providers to the factors that influence decisions they need to make as part of MACRA.  It is no longer under active development.

# Lessons Learned
- Together, technology and good design can drastically change the public perception of health policy.
- Policy outreach can be successful when it targets different tiers of the public (e.g., this prototype is big, colorful, accessible 101 but we should also allow for people to come up to graduate-level instruction on policies).
- For beginner-level policy outreach, start small and allow the user to expand their understanding on their own.  “Tell me more about…” links and selective disclosure help to slowly introduce information at the user’s request.
- Interactivity goes a long way toward getting people involved in policy rollout.  Show the public the different consequences of actions that they take under the new policy.  If you can include a calculator or a visual representation of these consequences, do so and make it prominent.
- It takes a cross-disciplinary team (Health Policy, Healthcare Providers, IT Developers, User Experience Designers) to be truly successful with something like this.
- A rapid prototype can quickly build interest in a tool or determine whether the portfolio/program division might be interested in picking it up as direct work.  It doesn’t need to be perfect, but it does need to display (or at least mock up) the full range of capability that you are looking to build.
