This is a website that introduces healthcare providers to the factors that influence decisions they need to make as part of MACRA.  It is not intended to make that decision for healthcare providers.  Rather, this site seeks to educate them about the many issues that need to be taken into account when deciding whether to pursue MIPS, an APM, or some combination of the two.
